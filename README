      THE INTERFACE MAY CHANGE.

DESCRIPTION
    Test::Reporter reports the test results of any given distribution to the
    CPAN testing service. See http://testers.cpan.org/ for details.

  METHODS

    * new
        This constructor returns a Test::Reporter object. It currently
        accepts no parameters, but will likely take named parameters in a
        future version.

    * subject
        Returns the subject line of a report, i.e. "PASS Mail-Freshmeat-1.20
        Darwin 6.0". 'grade' and 'distribution' must first be specified
        before calling this method.

    * report
        Returns the actual content of a report, i.e. "This distribution has
        been tested as part of the cpan-testers...". 'comments' must first
        be specified before calling this method, if you have comments to
        make and expect them to be included in the report.

    * comments
        Gets or sets the comments on the test report. This is optional, and
        most commonly used for distributions that did not pass a 'make
        test'.

    * errstr
        Returns an error message describing why something failed. You must
        check errstr() on a send() in order to be guaranteed delivery.

    * from
        Gets or sets the e-mail address of the individual submitting the
        test report, i.e. "Adam J. Foxson <afoxson@pobox.com>". This is
        mostly of use to testers running under Windows, since Test::Reporter
        will usually figure this out automatically.

    * grade
        Gets or sets the success or failure of the distributions's 'make
        test' result. This must be one of:

          grade     meaning
          -----     -------
          pass      all tests passed
          fail      one or more tests failed
          na        distribution will not work on this platform
          unknown   distribution did not include tests

    * distribution
        Gets or sets the name of the distribution you're working on, for
        example Foo-Bar-0.01. There are no restrictions on what can be put
        here.

    * send
        Sends the test report to cpan-testers@perl.org and cc's the e-mail
        to the specified recipients, if any. If you do specify recipients to
        be cc'd be sure that you use the author's @cpan.org address
        otherwise they will not be delivered.

    * timeout
        Gets or sets the timeout value for the submission of test reports.

TODO
      - More detailed error messages and reporting.
      - More tests.
      - Possibly use Net::DNS to get MX's for perl.org.
      - Cycle through all available MX servers, instead of just the first.
      - Encoding of data may be necessary.
      - Allow the constructor to take named parameters.
